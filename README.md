# Sven Version 1

**Sven Version 1** is a smart vending machine project. My most upgraded version can be found [here](https://repl.it/@KristinProudfoo/Java-Sven-version-1-Updated).

My current upgrade includes a clearScreen() method that gets rid of the extra info at the top of the output box 
and an admin password (the password is a constant set to "applesauce"). I also added colors to the choices 
displayed in the start of the program. 


*The lines of code that each change uses:*

*Password: 14, 31, 83, 84, 86*

*clearScreen(): 58, 189*

*Colors: 181*
